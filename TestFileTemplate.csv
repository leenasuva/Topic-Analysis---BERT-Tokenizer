"I mean the white walkers, not the wights. Was hoping for some fight scenes but they all just walked into Winterfell and stared at everyone menacingly."

Middleton probably does have green sweat considering all the Celtic tears he consumes
Wow someone posted detected repost and linked my own post this is so sad
Did we forget that hes a flaming pile of shit? Hes always been a dirty player with a nose you wish you could watch get picked off the ice out of a puddle of blood.
"Oh, I don‚Äôt think so"
"I can't, not again. I'm not strong enough."
Wooow you are so pretty
TIL I am a very passionate person.
I and a few other guys had a bottle of whiskey tucked inside a bundle of cables. The cableways are dense and in some places nearly a foot in diameter. It's pretty easy to reach up and put something small in a good spot. All you have to watch out for is make sure it's deep enough that it won't shake loose when the seas get rough and that you don't disturb any dust too much to make it noticeable. I took maybe two or three sips in total.
"Is this like a discount pun patrol? Just a bunch of fat guys eating donuts and throwing ""do not""s onto people saying puns?"
how would Josuke be pestilence? he'd fix the pestilence!
"Not to mention his wallet and phone are probably completely damaged, and those are small things compared to the physical damage he could've sustained like hitting his head on something."
Was trying to figure that out myself. Looked/sounded like Florida but the fact that the ponds didn't have alligators or turtles made me think otherwise.

I'm with you here. Mueller got gun shy and now complains about it.

"Rooting for them, they took a huge gamble at the trade deadline and I'd love to see it pay off. At the very least it would turn future deadlines into total chaos as other GMS attempt to replicate CBJ's success."

Corey is overestimating how hard a steel chair is.
you alright there bud?
I see nothing wrong with anything you said.
"I'm not saying that the battle or the plan was well written, but no one could've defended Winterfell from the dead. It could never have been a conventional victory."
No you wouldn‚Äôt stop lying to yourself. That other one is bullshit.. so boring. I want to see Mickey Mouse like this too.
"What happens with the Snap though? Does the Snap happen in each timeline? If it does, does that mean those timeline Avengers go back in time again to do what the mainline Avengers do, creating even more timelines?"
he lost that money
Those are all the ghost thoughts of the guys that wish they were there to fuck you. I know one of those was my secret wish to be there with your sexy self.
Coors light is ideal here. We call this drink 'Panty Strippers'

It seems like the servers and hit registration have gotten worse over time. Don‚Äôt even let me say anything about the audio bug. I don‚Äôt lag as much as most but every game I have a stealth assassin run up on me that I should‚Äôve heard 40 ft ago.
Please take this person's advise!!!! I have seen soooooo many men fucked over!! Dont be one!
"There's a reason why these games are often referred to as ""Roster Update 201X""."
You're entitled to your opinion but  I'm also entitled to not pay attention to it.
"Yeah ditto, probably watch it again at some point"
"""Leftists want to spin everything to make Trump look evil."""
Definitely could‚Äôve used a better shot

Thanks for the tips I've been getting my ass handed to me all day!
"You realize we are talking about civilian aircraft sold by Boeings civilian arm, yes?"
"10/10, would face plant."
So I tried something similar today. Had a pathfinder on the roof. Threw my jump pad in front of building not realizing there was a crawl space underneath. Jump pad went underneath. Had to embarrassingly climb the building.
Well the neighbor kid was mentally handicapped so he could only be so mad.  IIRC the only reason he came home for it was because the kid had broken the front door and it couldnt close.  So he didn't want to leave the appartment open all day.
Don‚Äôt worry all the immigrants President Trump drops off all throughout Cali should more than cover the cost right?
I have the same problem my friend ;(
I dont get it?
I love how they try to use the rationale that since she doesn‚Äôt agree with the transsexual lifestyle she should‚Äônt have a job. Sod off with that crap. She‚Äôs a successful woman who helped propel women‚Äôs MMA to first page news.
"Fixing the CGI is one thing, but the main issue that will continually crop up is that they didn't respect the source material. You can't fix that kind of problem without a rewrite."
Shit in your hat bud. Boo hoo the Internet is mean. Get over it
Talk to me when i had dairy.
Going up to greet a table and take drinks and seeing that they‚Äôve decided to reseat themselves
Yeah that‚Äôs a valid point! It‚Äôs just too bad that so many people are writing it off from just one trailer! I feel like the same thing happened to Solo: A Star Wars Story. Everyone hated on it before it even came out. I actually really enjoyed it. Hope the same thing doesn‚Äôt happen here!
